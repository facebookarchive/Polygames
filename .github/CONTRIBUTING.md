## Our Development Process

Any pull request will trigger continuous integration. Its configuration is
available [here](../.circleci/config).
In particular it defines tests that you should try to run locally as well:
- testing mcts and state C++ code
```Â 
./build/test_state
./build/torchRL/mcts/test_mcts 1 100
./build/torchRL/mcts/test_mcts 4 50
```
- testing the python tools:
```
pytest internal pypolygames --durations=10 --verbose
```

- trying a short training:
```
python -m pypolygames traineval --act_batchsize=2 \
  --batchsize=2 --replay_capacity=16  --replay_warmup=2 \
  --num_epoch=1 --num_game=12 --model_name=NanoFCLogitModel \
  --epoch_len=1 --device=cpu --game_name=TicTacToe --sync_period=1  --device_eval=cpu \
  --num_actor_eval=2 --num_rollouts_opponent=50 --num_game_eval=4
```
